# Hysterix-Circuit-Breaker

Step-by-step development of a Circuit Breaker Architecture using with Spring Boot. We would use the following tools:

    Spring Boot for developing the servers
    Feign Client for Microservices Communication
    Hystrix Circuit Breaker for handling failures
    Angular for building the UI application

The architecture would consist of four microservices.

    Primary Server(ProductServer1 port 8081)
    Secondary Server (ProductServer2 port 8082)
    Web API Application (ProductWeb port 8090)
    UI Application (ProductsUI port 8091)
